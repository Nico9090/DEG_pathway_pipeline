Experimental Design:

To understand how the creation of red blood cells is impacted by transcriptional changes in sickle cell anemia, researchers gathered 10 
reticulocyte samples with the same genes. 5 were sickle cell reticulocytes with HbS while the other 5 were normal reticulocytes with HbA.
Changes in transcription were counted among the genes.


Computational Workflow:
1) Download tsv of raw counts and human gene annotation table from NCBI
2) With R, transform the data so that it is sensible to graph and draw conclusions.
3) Visualize the data 
4) Write possible conclusions
6) Develop new research idea
