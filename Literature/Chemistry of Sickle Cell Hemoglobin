*Summary of experiment:* 

-sickle shape caused by (sickle cell hemoglobin)HbS polymerization
	
-Compare HbS and adult hemoglobin(HbA)
-HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated
-HbS polymerization is correlated with mutation in amino acid sequence
-computational analysis done to analyze the role Pro-Glu-Glu to Pro-Val-Glu mutation in HbS polymerization

*Findings:*


-Compared oxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin(OHbS,OHbA)
-Compared deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin and adult hemoglobin(dHbS, dHbA)
-Glycine 7 and Lysine 132 salt bridge on beta chain was greater in OHbA than dHbA
Shows that dHbA is stable
-higher torsion torsion increase between pro5-glu6 when HbA is deoxygenated compared to glu6-glu7
